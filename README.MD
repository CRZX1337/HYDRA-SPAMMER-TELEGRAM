## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features: Legion of Irritation

This script, in its amplified form, provides instruments for generating a more substantial digital discomfort:

*   **üêô Concurrent Multi-Account Spam:**
    *   Harness the power of **multiple Telegram accounts** to send messages **simultaneously**.
    *   Dramatically **increases spam volume** and potential impact.
    *   Distributes workload across accounts.

*   **üé≠ Versatile Message Types:** (Inherited from previous feeble versions, now amplified)
    *   **Single Custom Message:** Deploy the same monotonous phrase repeatedly across all accounts.
    *   **Multiple Custom Messages:** Cycle through a list of pre-scripted messages, rotated across all accounts.
    *   **üé≤ Random Message Generation:** Unleash truly senseless gibberish of adjustable length from each account.
    *   **‚ú® Dynamic Message Generation:** Create varied and unpredictable messages by combining phrases from `phrases.txt`, now deployed concurrently from every account.

*   **‚è±Ô∏è Adjustable Speed Modes:** Regulate the amplified message torrent:
    *   **üê¢ Normal Speed (Default):**  A slower, more "responsible" message stream across all accounts. Minimizes immediate detection (slightly).
    *   **üöÄ Maximum Speed (‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: EXTREME BAN RISK ‚ö†Ô∏è):** Unleash the combined, pathetic fury of *all* your accounts simultaneously.  Guaranteed to trigger flood controls and accelerate account‚Ä¶ incineration.  For fleeting moments of maximum, reckless chaos.

*   **‚ú® Animated User Interface:** (Still frivolous, but now for a legion of spam)
    *   Includes loading animations and progress bars, now reflecting the scale of multi-account operation.
    *   Animation delays remain configurable.

*   **üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling:** (Slightly more robust for multi-account operations)
    *   Error handling for common Telegram API issues (FloodWait, Blockages, Private Channels) is extended to manage multi-account scenarios.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation: Assembling Your Legion

Prepare your environment for commanding a legion of digital annoyance:

1.  **üêç Python:** Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Verify with: `python3 --version` or `python --version`.

2.  **üì¶ pip:** Confirm `pip` (Python package installer) is installed.

3.  **üìö Libraries:** Install necessary Python libraries using `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install telethon python-dotenv
    ```
    *   `telethon`: The Telegram API client, crucial for controlling your digital legion.
    *   `python-dotenv`: Still technically supported for optional settings, but account details are now managed via `accounts.txt`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration: Mobilizing the Legion

1.  **üîë Telegram API Keys:**  Acquire API access credentials from Telegram: [https://my.telegram.org/apps](https://my.telegram.org/apps). Obtain your `API ID` and `API Hash` for *each* account you intend to deploy.

2.  **üìù Create `accounts.txt` file:**  In the root directory of `hydra-spammer`, create a file named `accounts.txt`. **This is now MANDATORY for multi-account operation.**

3.  **‚úçÔ∏è Populate `accounts.txt`:** Edit `accounts.txt` with your API credentials and phone numbers for **each account**, referencing the `accounts.txt.example` template. **Keep this file highly secure.**

    ```text
    # accounts.txt - Example (replace with your actual account details)
    API_ID_ACCOUNT_1,API_HASH_ACCOUNT_1,+PHONE_NUMBER_ACCOUNT_1
    API_ID_ACCOUNT_2,API_HASH_ACCOUNT_2,+PHONE_NUMBER_ACCOUNT_2
    # Add more accounts below, one per line, following the format...
    ```

4.  **üìù (Optional) `phrases.txt` file:** For dynamic message spam, create `phrases.txt` in the root directory. Add phrases, one per line, for dynamic message generation.

5.  **üìù (Optional) `.env` file:** The `.env` file is now *optional* and primarily for customizing `NORMAL_SPEED_DELAY` and `USERNAME` (for advanced aesthetic customization only). See `.env.example`.

    ```
    NORMAL_SPEED_DELAY=0.75   # Optional: Adjust default delay (seconds)
    # USERNAME=LegionCommander # Optional: Personalize welcome message (utterly insignificant)
    ```

## üöÄ Quick Start: Unleash the Horde

1.  **Clone:** Clone this repository: `git clone [repository URL - *your responsibility to provide this* ]`
2.  **Configure Accounts:**  **MANDATORY:** Edit `accounts.txt` with your *multiple* API details.
3.  **Run:** Execute the script: `python tgspammer.py`
4.  **Authorize Accounts:**  The script will now prompt for authorization codes and 2FA passwords for **ALL** accounts at startup.  Authorize each when prompted.
5.  **Follow prompts:** The script will then request input to initiate the concurrent spamming process across your legion of accounts.
