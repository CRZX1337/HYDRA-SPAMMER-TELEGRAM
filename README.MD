<p align="center">
    HYDRA-SPAMMER is a Python-based Telegram spamming instrument designed for <ins> "stress testing," </ins> <ins> "educational purposes," </ins> and other activities involving the <ins> repetitive dissemination of digital messages. </ins> (The <ins> irony </ins> drips, does it not?)

## ⚙️ Key Features: Instruments of... <ins>Minor Irritation</ins>

This script, in its profoundly limited capacity, provides tools for generating digital… <ins>discomfort</ins>:

*   **🎭 Versatile Message Types:**
    *   **Single Custom Message:** Deploy the same <ins> monotonous phrase </ins> repeatedly. Ideal for achieving peak <ins>creative bankruptcy</ins>.
    *   **Multiple Custom Messages:** Cycle through a list of pre-scripted <ins>banalities</ins>. Offers a <ins> negligible </ins> increase in… <ins>unpredictability</ins>.
    *   **🎲 Random Message Generation:** Flood targets with genuinely <ins> nonsensical gibberish </ins>. Adjustable length, because even <ins>meaninglessness</ins> benefits from… <ins>customization</ins>.

*   **⏱️ Adjustable Speed Modes:** Regulate the <ins> trickle </ins> or <ins> flood </ins> of your digital… <ins>inconvenience</ins>:
    *   **🐢 Normal Speed (Default):** Emulate <ins>responsible usage</ins>. A <ins>feeble stream</ins> of messages designed to <ins>minimally evade detection</ins> and prolong the <ins>agony</ins> (for you and your target, perhaps). Recommended for <ins>prolonged, low-impact annoyance</ins>.
    *   **🚀 Maximum Speed (⚠️ WARNING: BAN RISK ⚠️):** Unleash the <ins> full, pathetic fury </ins> of your connection.  Hammer the target with messages at the absolute limit.  Guaranteed to trigger Telegram's <ins>irritating</ins> flood controls and expedite account… <ins>limitations</ins>. Use with <ins> disposable accounts </ins> for fleeting bursts of <ins> marginally </ins> increased chaos.

*   **✨ Animated User Interface:** For the user who is inexplicably <ins> captivated </ins> by visual distractions during spamming… "operations":
    *   Includes <ins>frivolous</ins> loading animations and progress bars. <ins>Superficially engaging</ins> but ultimately serving only to <ins> prolong execution time</ins> and distract from the script's inherent… <ins>pointlessness</ins>.
    *   Animation delays are <ins>configurable</ins>, allowing for <ins>utterly insignificant customization</ins>.

*   **🛡️ Error Handling:** For the inevitably <ins> inept </ins> user:
    *   Basic error handling for common Telegram API… <ins>hiccups</ins> (FloodWait, UserBlocked, etc.). Attempts to <ins>inform</ins> the user of their failures, however futile that may be.
    *   Minimizes user confusion (slightly) and allows the <ins> farcical spamming process </ins> to… <ins>continue</ins>, despite all reasonable objections.

## 🛠️ Installation: Assembling Your... <ins>Toy</ins>

Prepare your digital… <ins>playground</ins> for <ins>mild digital interference</ins>:

1.  **🐍 Python:** Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Verify with: `python3 --version` or `python --version`.

2.  **📦 pip:** Confirm `pip` (Python package installer) is installed. Typically included with Python. If absent, consult your operating system's documentation (if you are capable).

3.  **📚 Libraries:** Install necessary Python libraries using `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install telethon python-dotenv
    ```
    *   `telethon`: The Telegram API client. The mechanism for message… <ins>propagation</ins>.
    *   `python-dotenv`: For loading API keys from a `.env` file. To prevent… <ins>slightly</ins> increasing the risk of credential exposure.

## ⚙️ Configuration: Setting the Stage for... <ins>Digital Petulance</ins>

1.  **🔑 Telegram API Keys:**  Acquire API access credentials from Telegram: [https://my.telegram.org/apps](https://my.telegram.org/apps). Obtain your `API ID` and `API Hash`. (Like groveling before uncaring digital overlords).

2.  **📝 Create `.env` file:**  In the root directory of `hydra-spammer`, create a file named `.env`.

3.  **✍️ Populate `.env`:** Edit `.env` with your API credentials and phone number, referencing the ` .env.example` template. **Keep this file… <ins>mildly secure</ins>.**

    ```
    API_ID=YOUR_API_ID_HERE
    API_HASH=YOUR_API_HASH_HERE
    PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890 # Example: US number
    NORMAL_SPEED_DELAY=0.5   # Optional: Adjust delay (useless)
    # USERNAME=YourUsername    # Optional: Cosmetic fluff
    ```
